The following queries involved the use of subqueries to find information about the top 5 customers.

Average amount paid by top 5 customers:

SELECT total_amount_paid.first_name, total_amount_paid.last_name, total_amount_paid.avg_paid
FROM (SELECT E.customer_id, 
              A.first_name, 
              A.last_name,
              C.city,
              D.country,
              SUM(amount) AS total_paid, 
              AVG(amount) AS avg_paid
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B on A.address_id=B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C on B.city_id=C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D on C.country_id=D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E on A.customer_id=E.customer_id
WHERE D.country IN ('India', 'China', 'United States', 
                    'Japan', 'Mexico', 'Brazil', 'Russian Federation',
                    'Philippines', 'Turkey', 'Indonesia')
AND C.city IN ('Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dhule (Dhulia)',
               'Kurashiki', 'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Celaya', 'So Leopoldo')
GROUP BY E.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
    LIMIT 5) AS total_amount_paid
GROUP BY total_amount_paid.first_name, total_amount_paid.last_name, total_amount_paid.avg_paid
ORDER BY total_amount_paid.avg_paid DESC;

How many of top 5 customers are in each country:

SELECT D.country,
        COUNT(DISTINCT A.customer_id) AS call_customer_count,
        COUNT(DISTINCT top_5_customers.customer_id) AS top_customer_count
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B on A.address_id=B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C on B.city_id=C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D on C.country_id=D.country_id
LEFT JOIN (SELECT E.customer_id,
                  A.first_name,
                  A.last_name,
                  C.city,
                  D.country,
                  SUM(amount) AS total_paid,
                  AVG(amount) AS avg_paid
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B on A.address_id=B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C on B.city_id=C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D on C.country_id=D.country_id
INNER JOIN payment E on A.customer_id=E.customer_id
WHERE D.country IN ('India', 'China', 'United States',
                    'Japan', 'Mexico', 'Brazil', 'Russian Federation',
                    'Philippines', 'Turkey', 'Indonesia')
AND C.city IN ('Aurora', 'Atlixco', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Dhule (Dhulia)',
               'Kurashiki', 'Pingxiang', 'Sivas', 'Celaya', 'So Leopoldo')
GROUP BY E.customer_id, A.first_name, A.last_name, C.city, D.country
ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC
     LIMIT 5) AS top_5_customers ON D.country=top_5_customers.country
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY all_customer_count DESC;
