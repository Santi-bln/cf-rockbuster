# CF-Rockbuster
This demonstrates best practices for creating a GitHub repository using the sample project "Rockbuster".

## Objective
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores worldwide. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the company management plans to use existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service to stay competitive. 

## Data
The data set contains, among others, information on the following parameters:
-	Film inventory
-	Customers
-	Payments
-	Countries

The uploaded queries relate to business questions such as 
-	Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
-	Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
-	Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
